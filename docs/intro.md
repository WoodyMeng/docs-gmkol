## **1.2 Mission and vision**

In the cryptocurrency space, a significant challenge exists: many KOLs build fake or inactive communities, yet they receive substantial support from projects and gain exposure to new users through paid promotions. This creates a landscape where authentic and high-quality KOLs, who consistently produce valuable opinions and insightful content, are often overlooked and under-supported.

gmKOL is determined to change this dynamic. The platformâ€™s mission is to elevate high-quality KOLs by providing them with greater visibility and opportunities for financial support from projects. By leveraging AI-driven tools and community-driven engagement, gmKOL ensures that KOLs with genuine influence and impactful content are easily discoverable by crypto users and collaborators.

This vision seeks to create a fair and transparent ecosystem where quality and authenticity are rewarded, fostering a stronger connection between KOLs, crypto projects, and the broader community.

# **2. A Free Platform with MEMEs Support**

Unlike traditional Web2 platforms, gmKOL aims to conduct a social experiment to explore whether MEMEs can help build products and services. gmKOL will not charge any fees; instead, users are encouraged to hold gmKOLâ€™s meme token to collectively build the gmKOL community.

gmKOL has launched its meme token, **$TOM**, on pump.fun.

**CA (Contract Address): xxxx**

The revenue to sustain the gmKOL project will come from four token sales, based on the following timeline:

- The gmKOL development team will hold only **0.5%** of the total tokens.
- When $gmKOLâ€™s market cap reaches **$1M**, the team will sell **0.1%** of the tokens.
- When $gmKOLâ€™s market cap reaches **$10M**, the team will sell another **0.1%**.
- When $gmKOLâ€™s market cap reaches **$100M**, the team will sell another **0.1%**.
- When $gmKOLâ€™s market cap reaches **$1B**, the team will sell another **0.1%**.

The remaining **0.1%** will be permanently held by the team.

*If gmKOLâ€™s market cap does not reach $1M within 3 months, the experiment will conclude, and gmKOL will begin exploring a subscription-based model.

# **3. Roadmap**
